# Rustle ~ A Toy Synthesizer 

Rustle is a toy react project with the goal to explore the [WebAudio Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) by implementing a simple software synthesizer ui.

(Planned) features include:
- play notes with the keyboard
- choose between simple waveforms
- wrap the global volume into an adsr envelope
- modulate parameters with a simple lfo 
- apply a filter to the generated wave

The project was created with `create-react-app`, for running locally see next sections.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
